			<p> <b>Creation of the database description: </b></p>
			<p> For the database portion for this quiz, I have created a database that keeps track of the user's favorite videogame title and information about it. Gaming and creating videogames is a personal hobby of mine, so I saw the creation of this database appropriate to the requirements of the question. 
			In my database, I have seven tables: Player, Plays, Fav_Video_Games, Genre, Gameplay, Online_Compatibility, and Console.</p><br>	
				<ul style = text-align:justify>
					<li> <b>Player:</b> The player table contains three attributes that records the user's player_id, first_name, and last_name. For this table, each submission is associated to a unique player_id (which is autoincremented and never null). The player_id is also the primary key, and will be used as a foreign key in other tables to ensure a one to one relationship constraint. </li>
					<li> <b>Plays:</b> The plays table is a relationship table with one foreign key (player_id) and two none-primary attributes total_time_played and time_stamp. This table records the player's total time played in their favorite video game and the last date they played their video game. </li>
					<li> <b>Fav_Video_Games:</b> The table consists of nine attributes, player_id, purchase_cost, game_title, publisher, date_published, id_genre, id_gameplay, id_console, id_compatibility. This table has five foreign keys to avoid redundancy and duplicates of entries in the database; this is done by having the user select from a preset of values and those values are associated  to integer number.</li>
					<li> <b>Genre:</b> In the table, the user has five preset options to pick from, and each option has an associated  unique id number, genre_id. Genre_id also serves as a foreign key in the fav_games_table to reduce redundancy in entries.  </li>
					<li> <b>Gameplay:</b> In the table, the user has six preset options to pick from, and each option has an associated  unique id number, gameplay_id. Gameplay_id also serves as a foreign key in the fav_games_table to reduce redundancy in entries. </li>
					<li> <b>Online_Compatibility:</b> In the table, the user has two preset options to pick from, and each option has an associated  unique id number, compatibility_id. compatibility_id also serves as a foreign key in the fav_games_table to reduce redundancy in entries. </li>
					<li> <b>Console:</b> In the table, the user has five preset options to pick from, and each option has an associated  unique id number, console_id. Console_id also serves as a foreign key in the fav_games_table to reduce redundancy in entries.</li>
				</ul>
			<p> The ER diagram below shows all the tables created in the database, their attributes, attributes associated data types, and relationships with one another in Crows Foot notation: </p>
